Based on `CLIC_o3_v14` with the following modifications:
   * beampipe and nozzles replaced by the MAP version
   * modules of the Vertex Endcaps have flat layout as in FCCee instead of the CLIC's turbine-like arrangement
      * sensor thickness is twice smaller than in the barrel _(inherited by mistake from the FCCee configuration)_
   * adjusted inner radii of all subdetectors in the endcap region to fit the MAP nozzles inside
   * removed BeamCal, LumiCal and beam instrumentation
