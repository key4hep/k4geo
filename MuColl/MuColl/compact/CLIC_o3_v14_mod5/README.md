Based on `CLIC_o3_v14_mod4` with the following modifications:
   * Weaker magnetic field: 4.0T -> 3.57T to be consistent with MAP BIB
   * Vertex Endcap disks rearranged for better Theta coverage
   * Removed 1mm overlap of Vertex Endcap petals
   * Moved first disk of Inner Tracker closer to IP by 4mm
