Copy of `MuColl_v1.1` with increased amount of passive material in VTX detector by 500 um of Si - thickness of microchannel cooling plates used by the Phase2 upgraded VELO detector at LHCb.
Needed for evaluating the effect of increased material budget on occupancy due to secondary interactions of the BIB particles.
