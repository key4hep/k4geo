Based on `CLIC_o3_v14_mod2` with the following modifications:
   * optimised Vertex detector layout to be similar to the original MAP geometry
      * shorter barrel region with 3 -> 4 double-layers to avoid high occupancy around Â±13cm from the IP
      * higher endcap granularity with 3 -> 4 disks, using the same 50mum sensor thickness as in the barrel
