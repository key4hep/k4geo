Version 4 of the SiD option 2 model. Main changes and updates with respect to version 3:

- correct size and position of ECal layer 0 (via new driver ECalBarrel_o2_v04_geo.cpp)
- correct beam pipe (from Chris Potter)
- removed brass HCal model

Other than that, all files are the same as in version 3, just relabelled.
