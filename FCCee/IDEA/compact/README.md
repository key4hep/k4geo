IDEA
====
IDEA_o1_v01: IDEA version picked from the latest version in FCCDetectors repo
IDEA_o1_v02: Based on o1_v01 but with a detailed description of the vertex detector and the drift chamber
IDEA_o1_v03: Based on o1_v02 but replacing the drift chamber (o1, v01) for the lightweight implementation based on twisted tubes (o1, v02). Production threshold and step limit physics have to be tuned
