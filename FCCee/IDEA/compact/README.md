IDEA_o1_v01
------------

IDEA version picked from the latest version in FCCDetectors repo

IDEA_o1_v02
------------

Based on o1_v01 but with a detailed description of the vertex detector and the drift chamber, a place holder solenoid and the endplate absorber. Missing: SiWrapper, calorimeter, detailed muons system (coming soon).

IDEA_o1_v03
------------

Based on o1_v02 but replacing the drift chamber (o1, v01) for the lightweight implementation based on twisted tubes (o1, v02). Production threshold and step limit physics have to be tuned
