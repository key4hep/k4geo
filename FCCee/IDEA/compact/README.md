IDEA_o1_v01
------------

IDEA version picked from the latest version in FCCDetectors repo

IDEA_o1_v02
------------

Based on o1_v01 but with a detailed description of the vertex detector, drift chamber, a place holder solenoid and the endplate absorber. Missing: SiWrapper, calorimeter.

IDEA_o1_v03
------------

Based on o1_v02 but replacing the drift chamber (o1, v01) for the lightweight implementation based on twisted tubes (o1, v02). NB: production threshold and step limit physics have to be tuned for the drift chamber. July 2024: Added a detailed version of the muon system.
