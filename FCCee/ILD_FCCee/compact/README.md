##########################

- experimental version of ILD for FCCee
- based on ILD_l5_v02
- vertex detector and lumiCal copied from CLD_o2_v07
- inner silicon tracker adapted from CLD_o2_v07
- TPC inner radius slightly larger than ILD_l5_v02 model (329 -> 365 mm) to keep 150 mrad cone clear for MDI
- MDI taken from FCCee common MDI design
- ECal ring removed
- other subdetectors same as ILD_l5_v02
