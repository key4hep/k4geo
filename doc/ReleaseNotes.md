  * CLD_o3_v05 is created. This option evolves from option 2 version 05. The main characteristics with respect the mother version are:
  	- ARC subdetectors included between the trackers and the ECal. 
  	- Trackers are shrunk by 20 cm in radial and Z direction to accommodate the ARC. The space between layers is reduced proportionally, and the angular coverage is preserved.

  For the time being, separate the components to ensure correct material description. 
  (Consider recombining when sub-layer thicknesses are fixed and stable.)

   - added 'Hcal_endcap_thickness' the value came from 26.5*mm*48+15.0*mm. Fixed the 'Hcal_barrel_thickness' the value came from engineer, it is about 26.5*mm*48 and 0.3*mm of tolerance for the 'Hcal_outer_radius' maximum 3395.5*mm
   - Added two parameters 'Ecal_Barrel_thickness', and 'Hcal_Barrel_thickness', and use them to increase the ILD calorimeters (ECAL, HCAL) radius automaticly.
   - Update material for the Ecal ECRing module as Mokka used
   - Change the thickness of the scintillator in the active layer.
   - Updated 'detector/CaloTB/CaloPrototype_v02.cpp' and remove the hardcode layer/ identifier 'layer/K' in the testbeam geometry driver, get this string via segmentation, and use the defination in the compact xml file, whatever the user wanted, 'layer' or, 'K' ... .
   - added ID 'slice' in the geometry driver, and to be used in the cellEncoding string in compact file.
   - Updated SEcal04_Endcaps.cpp to set the Magic Wafer size in group tower, and set the group indentifier in the compact file for both Barrel (in layer group) and Endcaps (in tower group).
   - Use WaferGridXY segmentation for the EcalEndcapsCollection digitization in the DD4hep ILD_o1_v05, to improve the Magic wafer part in each layer too, as EcalBarrelCollection

D. Protopopescu

A.Sailer 02/02/2016
-------------------
  - ddsim
    * Add ExtraParticle tables
    * Add flag to define distance for vertexIsNotEndpointOfParent


N.Nikiforou 12/02/2016
----------------------
  - Changed Solenoid_o1_v01_geo.cpp and SCoil02_geo.cpp for proper filling of 
    solenoid extent in the LayeredCalorimeterStructure for use by DDMarlinPandora

N.Nikiforou 11/02/2016
----------------------
  - Fixed errors due to change of namespace of "_toDouble"
  - Added using of "DetType_AUXILIARY" for CLIC_o2_v04  ECalPlug and HCalRing


N.Nikiforou 10/02/2016
----------------------
  - Modified Tracker*_geo.cpp, Vertex*_geo.cpp, ZPlanarTracker_geo.cpp, GenericCal*_geo.cpp  to add setting detector type via xml tag
  - Moved CLIC_o2_v04 to using TrackerEndcap_o1_v04 drivers that set ZPetalDisksData according to minimum/maximum R and average Z
    of all rings in one endcap tracker disk (for DDMarlinPandora)
  - Added "type_flags" tags to all CLIC_o2_v04 subdetector xml files and added include of detector_types.xml

N.Nikiforou 03/02/2016
----------------------
  - Added deprecation warning for GenericSurfaceInstaller plugin which is now part of DD4hep. 
  - Moved CLIC_o2_v04 to using DDhep_GenericSurfaceInstallerPlugin rather than the local lcgeo implementation which is deprecated

A.Sailer 18/01/2016
-------------------
  - ddsim
    * Add RangeCut parameter
    * Add LargestAcceptableStep for magneticField (10*m)

N.Nikiforou 15/12/2015
----------------------
  - Switched CLIC_o2_v04 to using the GenericSurfaceInstaller. Changed therefore to using the following
    includes (notice _02 at the end of the name):
    * Vertex_o2_v04_02.xml
    * InnerTracker_o2_v03_02.xml
    * OuterTracker_o2_v03_02.xml
  - Changed the orientation of the endcap uvn vectors for Vertex and Tracker to 
    u(-1.,0.,0.), v(0.,0.,1.), n(0.,1.,0.), o(0.,0.,0.) using the GenericSurfaceInstaller rather than
    the individual surface installers (for which the orientation of uvn remains as before). The 
    vectors were set using plugin arguments in the xml. The resulting orientation puts v along R
    i.e. the "bad" measurement direction and u along -phi (clockwise). 
  - GenericSurfaceInstaller: by default all u,v,n,o vector components are now set to 0 which means 
    that the user has to define the non-zero components as arguments, otherwise the plugin fails
    
A.Sailer 15/12/2016
-------------------
  - ddsim
    * Add default filter with Edep > 0

N.Nikiforou 10/12/2015
----------------------
  - Added GenericSurfaceInstaller in detector/other to install surfaces to a given
    box-like volume. The u,v,n,o vectors are provided component-wise as arguments to the plugin.
    If the volumes are trapezoids (as in the case of the endcap) the thickness dimension is supposed to be 
    the same for both sides of the trapezoid (for example, dy1=dy2=dy) which is supposed to be handled
    when "casting" the Trapezoid shape into a Box
  - Added InnerTracker_o2_v03_02.xml and OuterTracker_o2_v03_02.xml in CLIC_o2_v04 (not used by default)
    as examples using the new GenericSurfaceInstaller
  
N.Nikiforou 04/12/2015
----------------------
  - Modified CLIC_o2_v04 to use proper convention for listing slices in module composition.
    In this convention, when you list a layer or a slice/component in a module, the top-most
    element in the xml is the component that is closest to the IP (top-most is inner-most).
  - Created new drivers and new xml files to use them
     * TrackerBarrel_o1_v03 and TrackerEndcap_o1_v03 used by Inner/OuterTracker_o2_v03.xml
     * VertexEndcap_o2_v03 used by Vertex_o2_v04_01
  - Created new surface installer plugins copied from DD4hep that follow the convention discussed above
    and used by the new drivers. They are listed below with the u,v,n and origin vectors as defined in 
    the driver coordinate system :
     * TrackerBarrelSurfacePlugin: u(-1.,0.,0.), v(0.,-1.,0.), n(0.,0.,1.), o(0.,0.,0.)
        + Assumes the driver builds the module along the original +z axis, with the top-most slice
          stacked perpendicular to z, closest to (0,0,0) with eventual rotations to place the module
          in the barrel so that the slice is inner-most. This is the case now in TrackerBarrel_o1_v03 
     * TrackerEndcapSurfacePlugin: u(0.,0.,1.), v(1.,0.,0.), n(0.,1.,0.), o(0.,0.,0.);
        + Assumes the driver builds the module along the original +y axis, with the top-most slice
          stacked perpendicular to y, closest to (0,0,0) with eventual rotations to place the module
          in the barrel so that the slice is inner-most. This is the case now in TrackerEndcap_o1_v03 

A.Sailer 30/11/2015
----------------------
  - Added steering of filter to ddsim
    * assign filters to sensitive detectors
    * create your own filters
  - Added dumpSteeringFile option to ddsim
    * prints steeringFile to stdout with current values as default

A.Sailer 23/11/2015
----------------------
 - Added information to the lcio runHeader in ddsim. This needs the DD4hep revision 1984!
   * The steeringFile content, commandline and resulting ddsim parameters are written
   * geant4 and dd4hep version is written directly in dd4hep.
   * user, workingdirectory and date are written as well

A.Sailer 06/10/2015
----------------------
 - ddsim python simulator
 * "ddsim --help" to print all the command line parameters currently available
 * example/steeringFile.py to see an example steering file with some options
 * to enable tab-completion for ddsim: requires bash (or zsh),bash-completion, and python argcomplete
   (e.g. install with: [sudo] pip install argcomplete)
   in the shell run: eval "$(register-python-argcomplete ddsim)"


N.Nikiforou 24/08/2015
----------------------
 - Modified CLIC_o2_v03/ECalBarrel_o2_v01_01.xml, ECalEndcap_02_v01_01.xml and
   ECalPlug_o1_v01_01.xml to avoid having layers without active element
   which complicates implementation for reconstruction.
   This was the case for the last (outermost) dead layer (absorber only).
   Instead, added one more type of layer with only one repeat which includes the extra
   absorber plate
 - Fixed bug (?) in CLIC_o2_v03/ECalEndcap_02_v01_01.xml and ECalPlug_o1_v01_01.xml
   which had different siPCBMix thickness compared to the ECalBarrel (1.20 mm -> 0.80 mm). 


N. Nikiforou 19/08/2015 
-----------------------

   M.Petric
   - Made a new version for CLIC named CLIC_o2_v03 which includes better representations
     of X0 in the Trackers
   N. Nikiforou
   - Added new Generic Calorimeter drivers based on Polyhedra Calorimeters named
     GenericCalBarrel and GenericCalEndcap. The Generic drivers
     were obtained by svn cp from HCalBarrel and HCalEndcap respectively and are used
     in the CLIC_o2_v03 model by the ECal, HCal and Yoke Endcaps, Barrels and Rings.
     These new drivers (almost identical to the old ones) will be used to avoid making 
     changes in all the drivers while developing the reconstruction framework.
     Changes include:
     - Cleaning up of old comments, old code snippets and featurs no longer used (like
       multiple sensitive elements per layer which will not be supported by the reco).
     - Introduction of the new LayeredCalorimeterStruct variables defined in DDRec:
       - inner/outer thicknesses, nRad/nIntLengths and sensitive element thicknesses
     - Avoidance of cloning of element volumes in the barrel case
     - Start of counters (e.g. layer, module, stave, etc) from 0 rather than 1

# v00-05

   N. Nikiforou
   - Added TrackerEndcap_o1_v02_geo.cpp (svn cp'd from TrackerEndcap_o1_v01_geo.cpp) which supports 
     ILD ID encoding and implements ring modules. Elements (enumerated as "sensors") in one ring 
     (constant R) have the same "module" number but different sensor number. 
     Also modified the CLIC_o2_v02 model compact (InnerTracker_o2_v01_01.xml 
     and OuterTracker_o2_v01_01.xml) to use the new driver. Also now implements the "side" bitfield
     side=0 is positive, side=1 is negative. 
   - Introduced new driver VertexEndcap_o1_v02 and necessary changes to compact file for CLIC_o2_v02.
     The new xml also implements double layers in the endcap but with each layer having its own ID. 
     Also, in the new VertexEndcap driver similar changes as above VertexEndcap.


   S.Lu 
   - updated Ecal and Hcal in Share_ILD_o1_CLIC

      - use Geant4ScintillatorCalorimeterAction
        as defaults for all calorimeters
      - use TPCSDAction for TPC 


   A.Sailer
     - Implemented FieldMapBrBz.cpp, based on the 2D Fieldmap of Mokka FieldX03
     - Example XML for the fields section of the compact XML

            <field name="DetectorMap" type="FieldBrBz"
                   filename="${lcgeo_DIR}/fieldmaps/ILDMap_KB_20150204_BRhoZ.root"
               tree="fieldmap:rho:z:Brho:Bz"
               rScale = "1.0"
               zScale = "1.0"
               bScale = "1.0"
               rhoMin = "5*mm"
               zMin = "5*mm"
               rhoMax = "7005*mm"
               zMax = "7005*mm"
               nRho = "701"
               nZ = "701"
               >
            </field>

     - added ./fieldmaps/ILDMap_KB_20150204_BRhoZ.root
